## Final report

The inventory management system is coded in Python and utilizes various data structures, including dictionaries, lists, tuples, stacks, priority queues, and heaps. It addresses these data structures in performing CRUD operations on inventory categories and products.

Functions such as updating a product or category, updating the price, increasing and decreasing product quantity, and searching a product or category using the name and price range are also implemented.

LRU cache and manual memoization using dictionaries have been implemented to improve the search performance when the application is scaled to handle large data sets.

Additionally, the project includes test cases that validate the effectiveness of the chosen data structures.
